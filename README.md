# Tool-Enhanced Reasoning Script

A Python script that combines Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning with external tools to solve complex natural language queries. The system uses chain-of-thought prompting to break down problems and automatically calls mathematical and string analysis tools when needed.

## üöÄ Features

- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo to break down complex queries step-by-step
- **Automatic Tool Detection**: Intelligently identifies when external tools are needed
- **Mathematical Tools**: Calculator, averages, square roots, factorials, prime checking, etc.
- **String Analysis Tools**: Vowel counting, letter counting, word analysis, palindrome detection, etc.
- **Interactive Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line interface with example queries
- **Detailed Output**: Shows reasoning steps, tool usage, and final answers

## üìä Example Queries and Outputs

### Example 1: Mathematical Calculation

**Query**: "What's the square root of the average of 18 and 50?"

**Output**:

```
ü§î Processing query: What's the square root of the average of 18 and 50?
============================================================

üß† Initial Reasoning:
I need to solve this step by step:

1. First, I need to calculate the average of 18 and 50
2. Then, I need to find the square root of that average

Let me start:

TOOL_CALL: average(18, 50)

üîß Tool Calls Detected:
  - Calling average(18, 50)
    Result: 34.0

üéØ Final Reasoning:
Now I have the average of 18 and 50, which is 34.0. Next, I need to find the square root of 34.0.

TOOL_CALL: square_root(34.0)

The square root of 34 is approximately 5.83.

Therefore, the square root of the average of 18 and 50 is approximately 5.83.

‚úÖ Final Answer: The square root of the average of 18 and 50 is approximately 5.83.
```

### Example 2: String Analysis

**Query**: "How many vowels are in the word 'Multimodality'?"

**Output**:

```
ü§î Processing query: How many vowels are in the word 'Multimodality'?
============================================================

üß† Initial Reasoning:
I need to count the vowels in the word 'Multimodality'.

TOOL_CALL: count_vowels(Multimodality)

üîß Tool Calls Detected:
  - Calling count_vowels(Multimodality)
    Result: 6

üéØ Final Reasoning:
The word 'Multimodality' contains 6 vowels.

‚úÖ Final Answer: The word 'Multimodality' contains 6 vowels.
```

### Example 3: Comparison Query

**Query**: "Is the number of letters in 'machine' greater than the number of vowels in 'reasoning'?"

**Output**:

```
ü§î Processing query: Is the number of letters in 'machine' greater than the number of vowels in 'reasoning'?
============================================================

üß† Initial Reasoning:
I need to compare two values:
1. The number of letters in 'machine'
2. The number of vowels in 'reasoning'

Let me calculate both:

TOOL_CALL: count_letters(machine)
TOOL_CALL: count_vowels(reasoning)

üîß Tool Calls Detected:
  - Calling count_letters(machine)
    Result: 7
  - Calling count_vowels(reasoning)
    Result: 4

üéØ Final Reasoning:
Now I can compare:
- Number of letters in 'machine': 7
- Number of vowels in 'reasoning': 4

Since 7 > 4, yes, the number of letters in 'machine' is greater than the number of vowels in 'reasoning'.

‚úÖ Final Answer: Yes, the number of letters in 'machine' (7) is greater than the number of vowels in 'reasoning' (4).
```

### Example 4: Complex Mathematical Query

**Query**: "What's 15 factorial divided by 10 factorial?"

**Output**:

```
ü§î Processing query: What's 15 factorial divided by 10 factorial?
============================================================

üß† Initial Reasoning:
I need to calculate 15! √∑ 10!

Let me calculate both factorials first:

TOOL_CALL: factorial(15)
TOOL_CALL: factorial(10)

üîß Tool Calls Detected:
  - Calling factorial(15)
    Result: 1307674368000
  - Calling factorial(10)
    Result: 3628800

üéØ Final Reasoning:
Now I can divide:
15! = 1,307,674,368,000
10! = 3,628,800

15! √∑ 10! = 1,307,674,368,000 √∑ 3,628,800 = 360,360

‚úÖ Final Answer: 15 factorial divided by 10 factorial equals 360,360.
```

### Example 5: String Comparison with Multiple Tools

**Query**: "How many consonants are in the longest word: 'artificial', 'intelligence', or 'reasoning'?"

**Output**:

```
ü§î Processing query: How many consonants are in the longest word: 'artificial', 'intelligence', or 'reasoning'?
============================================================

üß† Initial Reasoning:
I need to:
1. Find the longest word among 'artificial', 'intelligence', and 'reasoning'
2. Count the consonants in that longest word

Let me first check the length of each word:

TOOL_CALL: get_word_length(artificial)
TOOL_CALL: get_word_length(intelligence)
TOOL_CALL: get_word_length(reasoning)

üîß Tool Calls Detected:
  - Calling get_word_length(artificial)
    Result: 10
  - Calling get_word_length(intelligence)
    Result: 12
  - Calling get_word_length(reasoning)
    Result: 9

üéØ Final Reasoning:
The word lengths are:
- 'artificial': 10 letters
- 'intelligence': 12 letters
- 'reasoning': 9 letters

The longest word is 'intelligence' with 12 letters. Now I need to count the consonants in 'intelligence':

TOOL_CALL: count_consonants(intelligence)

The word 'intelligence' has 7 consonants.

‚úÖ Final Answer: The longest word is 'intelligence' and it contains 7 consonants.
```

## üß† How the Prompt Decides Tool Usage

The system uses a carefully crafted prompt that:

1. **Lists Available Tools**: Shows the LLM all available functions with their descriptions
2. **Provides Clear Instructions**: Tells the LLM to use `TOOL_CALL: function_name(arguments)` format
3. **Encourages Step-by-Step Thinking**: Uses chain-of-thought prompting to break down problems
4. **Pattern Matching**: The script uses regex to detect `TOOL_CALL:` patterns in the LLM response
5. **Argument Parsing**: Automatically converts string arguments to appropriate types (int, float, string)

The key insight is that the LLM naturally identifies when calculations or string analysis are needed and formats tool calls accordingly when given clear instructions and examples.
